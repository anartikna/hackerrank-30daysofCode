The absolute difference between two integers,  and , is written as . The maximum absolute difference between two integers in a set of positive integers, , is the largest absolute difference between any two integers in .

The Difference class is started for you in the editor. It has a private integer array () for storing  non-negative integers, and a public integer () for storing the maximum absolute difference.

Task
Complete the Difference class by writing the following:

A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the  instance variable.
A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any  numbers in  and stores it in the  instance variable.

class Difference:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.__elements = a
        self.maximumDifference = 0

    def computeDifference(self):
        l = len(a)
        for i in range(0, l):
            for j in range(i + 1, l):
                difference = abs(a[i] - a[j])
                self.maximumDifference = max(difference, self.maximumDifference)

# End of Difference class

a = [int(e) for e in input().split(' ')]

d = Difference(a)
